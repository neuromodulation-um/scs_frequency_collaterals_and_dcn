# scs_frequency_collaterals_and_dcn

Code to generate models of dorsal column nucleus (DCN) neurons and primary afferent terminations within the dorsal horn, 
as described in "Biophysics of Frequency-Dependent Variation in Paresthesia and Pain Relief during Spinal Cord Stimulation" by
Rogers, Capogrosso, and Lempka (JNeurosci, 2024) (https://www.jneurosci.org/content/44/26/e2199232024).

To create a DCN cell (in python):

from DCN import *
dcn_Cell = DCN()
